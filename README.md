# Predict Students Academic Success

### Overview
&emsp;&emsp;The ultimate goal of higher education institutions is to prepare students for successful careers and graduate highly qualified candidates into the workforce for the betterment of society. Unfortunately, there are many obstacles and barriers to accomplishing this goal. As of 2021, only 33.7% of the population aged 25 and over have completed a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher in the U.S. One of the biggest problems that higher education institutions face is student dropout rates. Of all the students that enroll in a college institution, more than half fail to complete their degree. Understanding the reasons why is a crucial first step toward addressing the problem and improving graduation rates.

&emsp;&emsp;A machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a student will drop out or graduate can provide necessary insights and recommendations that enable universities to address the issues causing students to drop out and develop strategies to improve student success. In the following analysis, I will be using a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naveenkumar20bps1137/predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success) to analyze student success factors and develop multiple supervised machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine to predict students who are likely to be successful in academic.
